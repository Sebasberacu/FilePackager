# File Packager
Segundo Proyecto - Sistemas Operativos. II semestre 2023

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of a file packer that seeks to replicate the essential functionality of the well-known *tar* command in UNIX environments. It has been developed with the purpose of reinforcing knowledge and experience in the management of directories, files and contiguous memory, fundamental aspects in the operation of operating systems. The creation of this program was done as a project for an operating systems course at the university.
Allows users to create a single archive that stores multiple individual files (like a compressed file), it offers the basic operations of creating, extracting, listing, deleting, updating, aggregating and defragmenting; this last option is an innovative functionality that defragments the content stored in the compressed file and free up any unused space. That is, with this command all free blocks will be liberated and the size of the compressed file will be adjusted to the actual existing content.

## Documentation
The formal documentation is inside the project folder as "doc.pdf". In it, there is a detailed explanation of the functionality of the program, the followed logic, and some functionality tests, for all the commands.

## Developed By
This project has been developed by Sebastián Bermúdez (the owner of this repo) allong my college partner, Felipe Obando.
